# Flippable Cards

A simple flippable card with the flip animation. The card has rounded borders; in the front side has a background-image and text over it; and in the back side, it has text describing the image.

## How does it works?

The flip animation is made with a rotateY() CSS property in the .card wich has the .front and the .back sides. When user hovers the .card, it flips. And also, the .back must need to have the rotateY() CSS property.
